## Using git

git is a command line version control system. We can use it from RStudio (via the "git pane" in the upper left) or from the command line (i.e. in the "terminal tab").

The steps to using git involve:
- initiating a git repository 
  `git init`
  or click the check box in RStudio
   
- Do your work (same as always)
  add files
  edit files
  save files
  
- **Add files you care about to the "stage"**
  `git add yourfilename`
  or click to add to stage in RStudio

- **Commit your changes**
  `git commit -m "Message"`
  or click to commit in RStudio
